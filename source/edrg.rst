EDRG
====

EDRG (EXPERIMENTALISTS AND DIAGNOSTICIANS RESOURCE GROUP) is one of the
two projects falling under the coordination of the Leadership of the EU
Task Force for Integrated Tokamak Modelling (EU-IM) and is the privileged
contact of the EU-IM with the experimentalists and diagnosticians
community.

Scientific Rationale and Main Objectives
----------------------------------------

The consolidation of the validated suite of simulation tools that the
EU-IM aims to provide for ITER and existing experiments requires a strong
interaction with the experimentalists and diagnosticians fusion
community. The former are promoted by the Experimentalist and
Diagnosticians Resource Group (EDRG).
Acting as a contact point within the EU-IM towards the full range of
experiments and some of the EFDA Topical Groups and Working Group
initiatives, the EDRG group promotes the provision of a machine
independent approach to modelling, to encompass realistic operational
conditions and to facilitate
verification
and
validation
of the modelling codes.
The groups action comprises

1. Developing a comprehensive set of Machine descriptions and
experimental data mappings to access experimental databases from
european devices.

2. The coordination of the overall plasma control activities to be
carried within the EU-IM-TF and in liaison with other EFDA initiatives.

3. The integration of synthetic diagnostic modules to assist
Verification and Validation of EU-IM modules and virtual PCS.

Machine Descriptions and Data Mappings
--------------------------------------

At the forefront of the EDRG activities, the consolidation of the
machine descriptions and data mappings for the experimental data on the
participating devices is of utmost importance.

Machine Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

The machine description (MD) of a device basically builds on the set of
engineering and diagnostic settings characterising any device. This
includes, for instance, the vessel/limiter description (for the moment
in R-Z domain only), the PF coils and circuiting and lines of sight of
diagnostics (an example for ITER is seen below evidencing the
vessel+limiter+pfsystems and magdiad CPOs).
In practice, all MD information is encapsulated in a XML file that
emanates from the MD tagged datastructure schemas. A MD instance of a
given device is then stored into the EU-IM db as shot 0 for that device
database.
At data structure version 4.09a, the list of CPOs with machine
description tags is indicated in the Figure below

Tutorial and specific information on some CPOs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  A good introduction to the machine description concept is found in
   this
   User Guide
   .
-  Up to data version 4.07c, the geometry of lines of sight used in some
   diagnostics (interfdiag and polardiag) was characterized by two
   angles (poloidal and toroidal). A caveat was found, leading to the
   adoption of a new set of angles as described in this
   report
   . The pivot points became 3 (previously 2) to encompass slightly
   different entry/exit positions for the reflected beams.
-  From data version 4.09a, the limiter, nbi and antennas CPOs use
   arrays of structures data types. This enabled a more refined
   description of plasma facing components and the divertor region and
   both open and closed 'tile' elements. Each NBI and antenna unit is
   also a dedicated structure.
-  Detailed definitions are available for
   Flux loop position
   ,
   PFconnections
   ,
   Langmuir probes
   and
   Fusion CPO

Data Mappings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

In regard to the experimental data from a particular shot/device set,
the EU-IM had to develop its own tool to retrieve the data from the
experimental databases and populate the corresponding EU-IM db entry since
the latter rarely adopt the same datastructure ontology and different
methods/implementation for the databases might exist on different
devices. A XML file contains all the mapping essentials, e.g. download
method, local signal names, gains and offsets, time base and eventual
interpolation option to ensure that only one time base is set for each
CPO
that is built from multiple local signals. A java code (exp2EU-IM
developed under ISIP), with the MD and DM files as inputs, is then run
to connect to the local device database, retrieve the required
experimental data and populate the EU-IM db instance for that shot/device
and dataversion.
At data structure version 4.09a, the list of CPOs with data mappings
tags is indicated in the Figure below (experimental signals are colored
in orange; mappings to other CPOs, e.g. equilibrium or coreprof have
been set in order to assist the retrieval of simulated data from other
databases, e.g. JSP, JSPC)
