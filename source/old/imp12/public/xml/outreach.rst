Outreach
========

With the modules in IMP12 coming to a mature level, the project is
starting outreach collaborations to promote the use of the ITM tools
within EFDA.
A small list of existing outreach collaborations is given below. This
list is not necessarily complete but should protocol the ongoing efforts
to exploit ITM tools.
Linear MHD Stability Chain at JET
---------------------------------

The aim of this effort is to benchmark and verify the ITM modules HELENA
and ILSA against the versions of HELENA and MISHKA_1 currently used at
JET for linear MHD stability calculations. Replacing the JET tools by
the corresponding ITM tools may be considered.

-  Main project contact:
   Christian Perez von Thun
-  ITM Contact:
   Christian Konz
-  Start Date:
   03/2010
-  Steps completed so far:

   -  Mapping from JET EFIT equilibrium reconstruction to ITM HELENA
      equilibrium CPO input

-  Current stage:
   testing of ITM
   linear MHD stability workflow
   using JET mapped data

EQUINOX at Tore Supra
---------------------

The aim of this effort is to run the ITM tool EQUINOX on Tore Supra
data.

-  Main project contact:
   Didier Mazon
-  ITM Contact:
   Blaise Faugeras
-  Start Date:
   12/2010
-  Steps completed so far:

   -  initial contact

-  Current stage:
   project start

EQUAL at Tore Supra
-------------------

The aim of this effort is to run the ITM tool EQUAL for intershot
equilibrium reconstruction on Tore Supra.

-  Main project contact:
   Fr√©deric Imbeaux
-  ITM Contact:
   Wolfgang Zwingmann
-  Start Date:
   12/2010
-  Steps completed so far:

   -  initial contact

-  Current stage:
   project start

Interfacing the Fixfree code to ETS
-----------------------------------

The aim of this effort is to use the Fixfree as a Free-Boundary code to
be interfaced to the ETS transport solver

   Roberto Paccagnella
-  ITM Contact:
   Edmondo Giovannozi
-  Start Date:
   4/2011
-  Steps completed so far:
