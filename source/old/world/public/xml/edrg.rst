EDRG
====

EDRG (EXPERIMENTALISTS AND DIAGNOSTICIANS RESOURCE GROUP) is one of the
two projects falling under the coordination of the Leadership of the EU
Task Force for Integrated Tokamak Modelling (ITM) and is the privileged
contact of the ITM with the experimentalists and diagnosticians
community.

Scientific Rationale and Main Objectives
----------------------------------------

The consolidation of the validated suite of simulation tools that the
ITM aims to provide for ITER and existing experiments requires a strong
interaction with the experimentalists and diagnosticians fusion
community. The former are promoted by the Experimentalist and
Diagnosticians Resource Group (EDRG).
Acting as a contact point within the ITM towards the full range of
experiments and some of the EFDA Topical Groups and Working Group
initiatives, the EDRG group promotes the provision of a machine
independent approach to modelling, to encompass realistic operational
conditions and to facilitate
verification
and
validation
of the modelling codes.
The groups action comprises

1. Developing a comprehensive set of Machine descriptions and
experimental data mappings to access experimental databases from
european devices.

2. The coordination of the overall plasma control activities to be
carried within the ITM-TF and in liaison with other EFDA initiatives.

3. The integration of synthetic diagnostic modules to assist
Verification and Validation of ITM modules and virtual PCS.
