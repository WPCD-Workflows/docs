EU-IM-TF Achievements
===================

During the first phase of the EU-IM-TF, surveys and cross-verification of
the available European models and numerical codes were performed within
the individual IMPs and the data-structure was extensively discussed and
defined. Equilibrium, linear MHD stability, core transport and RF wave
propagation, as well as the poloidal field systems and a few diagnostics
were the first topics addressed. Data structures have been finalised for
these and then expanded to address, among others, non-linear MHD, edge
physics, turbulence and neutral beam propagation. In parallel to the
development of the physics concepts, EU-IM-TF developed the tools to
manipulate the data structure and use it in fully flexible and modular
simulation workflows. The EU-IM database contains machine descriptions
from JET, Tore Supra, MAST, FTU, FAST, AUG, ITER as well as some
experimental data from Tore Supra and JET. The EU-IM-TF futher achieved
the development of the first release version of a fully modular and
versatile simulator, the ETS, with all the essential functionalities.
The validation of the ETS simualtor started in 2010 against the
state-of-the-art transport codes and ETS now starts to be used for the
first physics applications. Next steps are the validation of the
simulator for a complete discharge on existing experimental data with
the available modules, the integration of more quantitative physics
models ("ab-initio") and the integration of the whole modelling of the
device.
Some posters that describe the EU-IM were presented at an EU-IM EXPO at the
2011 EPS fusion conference in Strasbourg. Copies can be found
