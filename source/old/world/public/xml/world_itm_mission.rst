The ITM-TF Mission
==================

The ITM-TF operated under EFDA from 2004 until 2013. The main mission of
ITM-TF was to provide a software infrastructure framework for EU
integrated modelling activities as well as a validated suite of
simulation codes for the modelling of present experiments, ITER and DEMO
plasmas. The ITM-TF operated until 2013 under a work programme
formulated to support this goal, structuring the EU modelling effort
around existing experiments and ITER scenario prediction while
maintaining a long term strategic aim to provide a validated set of
European modelling tools for ITER exploitation.
