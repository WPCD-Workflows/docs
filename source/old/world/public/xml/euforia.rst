EUFORIA
=======

EUFORIA (EU Fusion fOR Iter Applications) is a project funded by
European Union under the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) which will
provide a comprehensive framework and infrastructure for core and edge
transport and turbulence simulation, linking grid and High Performance
Computing (HPC), to the fusion modelling community.

Scientific Rationale and Main Objectives
----------------------------------------

The EUFORIA project will enhance the modelling capabilities for ITER
sized plasmas through the adaptation, optimization and integration of a
set of critical applications for edge and core transport modelling
targeting different computing paradigms as needed (serial and parallel
grid computing and HPC). Deployment of both a grid service and a High
Performance Computing services are essential to the project. A novel
aspect is the dynamic coupling and integration of codes and applications
running on a set of heterogeneous platforms into a single coupled
framework through a workflow engine a mechanism needed to provide the
necessary level integration in the physics applications. This strongly
enhances the integrated modelling capabilities of fusion plasmas and
will at the same time provide new computing infrastructure and tools to
the fusion community in general.
