AMNS
====

Scientific Rationale and Main Objectives
----------------------------------------

The EU-IM has a broad need for data relating to atomic, molecular, nuclear
and surface data (AMNS). In particular, AMNS data are needed in several
of the EU-IM modelling projects. A consistent approach, taking into
account the specific requirements of the EU-IM while maintaining the work
aligned with other European efforts in this area, is therefore required.
As a consequence the AMNS tasks are implemented as Tasks under the TF
leadership and has the following scope:

- Coordination of the work in the four different sub areas.

- Supply of data not presently residing in easily accessible data bases.

- Identify any Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection needs in
view of a broader collaboration with ITER partners.

- Provide software for delivery of AMNS data to EU-IM-TF codes
