IMP12 - Equilibrium, MHD, and Disruptions
-----------------------------------------

Scientific Rationale and Main Objectives of the Task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of the IMP12 activity is to provide the ITM-TF with a
comprehensive set of
equilibrium, linear stability, and non-linear MHD modelling tools
as well as the tools for a consistent free boundary equilibrium
evolution with application to the study of plasma disruptions. The
project aims at providing ITER relevant modelling capabilities covering
essential areas in an MHD simulation chain, starting from equilibrium
reconstruction and free boundary evolution under feedback control via
linear and non-linear MHD stability to non-linear MHD stability and
plasma disruptions.
Scope and Long Term Perspective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mature consolidation of a substantial part of the tools developped
by IMP1 (equilibrium reconstruction and linear MHD stability) prompts
for continued maintenance and integration.
Because of the synergy between equilibrium/linear stability and
non-linear MHD modelling integration, IMP1 and IMP2 have been merged as
off 2010.
Adopting a unifying strategy, the project therefore now consolidates the
coverage of essential MHD numerical tools.
Validation
of the
full chain of equilibrium reconstruction
and
linear stability
codes has started in 2009 and will proceed in collaboration with the MHD
Topical Group, addressing relevant experimental scenarios (disruptive
limits, edge stability limits,...). Collaborations with additional
experiments is planned.
Extension of the equilibrium and linear stability codes as well as the
data structures to include
plasma flow
and
3D effects
will consolidate the scope of the present tools.
Validation of the existing modules for modelling of a
free boundary equilibrium on experiments
and
integration with the ETS
, mediated by
feedback control schemes
, will enhance the whole device modelling capabilities of ITM tools.
Interfacing with
non-linear stability modules
dedicated to
sawtooth, NTM, ELMs, error fields
, and
beta limit pertinent modules
, such as the
RWM
will be facilitated.
Alongside such efforts, both
2D and 3D MHD non-linear stability modules
will be integrated in the platform, with privileged application to
further development for
VDE/disruption
capability, including work towards a "real time" disruption predictor
for ideal MHD limits.
