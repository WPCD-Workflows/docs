====

IMP4
----

The IMP4 web site is `here. <http://www.rzg.mpg.de/~bds/cyclone/>`__

Scientific Rationale and Main Objectives
----------------------------------------

Provide turbulence, neoclassical, and linear instability codes as well
as simple transport modules to the rest of the EU-IM. Also, some standards
keeping. For more detail see above.

Documentation
-------------

Some of this exists here but most is on the main page. However, all
relevant links are here:

-  running the IMP4 benchmark
-  IMP4 codes in EU-IM workflows
-  an example of how to get CPO information including parameters into
   your code is the
   ETAIGB project
   on
   Gforge
-  for ETS/IMP3 users:
   test workflows for IMP4 actors
-  serving transport quantities to the rest of EU-IM
-  the running exponential average
-  how to load the
   coretransp
   CPO
-  Neoclassical code comparisons

   -  bootstrap current
   -  Ds and Chis

-  auxiliary IMP4 actors (like Ds and Vs, flux handling, etc)

Private IMP4 pages
------------------

None exist (they may do in the future... for now I want IMP4 stuff open
to the rest of the EU-IM).

(For access to the `private IMP4
pages <https://www.efda-itm.eu/IMP4/html/index.html>`__, an IMP4
password would have been needed)
