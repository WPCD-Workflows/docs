The Welcome EU-IM platform User Guide
===================================

Welcome!

Welcome to the Newcomer's guide to EFDA-EU-IM platform!

The `Integrated Tokamak Modeling <https://portal.eufus.eu/portal/>`__
is a project of `European Fusion Development
Agreement <http://www.efda.org/>`__ with the aim to providing software
instruments to forecast and interpret discharges from
`ITER <http://www.iter.org/>`__ and from DEMO. Therefore it deals with
making codes developed by the European fusion community interact, with
promoting the developing of codes on issues not yet faced and with
validating the codes themselves.

To this purpose it is organised in 4 Integrated Modeling Projects
(IMP12: MHD, IMP3: Transport, IMP4: Turbulence, IMP5: Heating and
Current Drive), one Infrastructure and Software Integration Project
(ISIP, with the purpose of providing developing and data analysis tools
specific for fusion, together with the connective tissue among different
codes and with the support to EU-IM members) and 2 interdisciplinary
projects: the Experimentalist and Diagnostician Resource Group (EDRG)
and the Atomic, Molecular Nuclear and Surface (AMNS).

Moreover, it disposes of a Linux cluster of 128 cores with a peak
performance of 1 teraflops: `Gateway <http://www.eufus.eu/>`__, which
can be used for the developing and testing of the codes, and which is
provided with ad hoc tools of pre- and post- processing and of
interconnection between codes. Gateway also hosts the EU-IM data base
storage (100TB), the EU-IM web site and the EU-IM cooperative work
`portal <https://portal.eufus.eu/portal/>`__. For massive production
it is possible to use part of the supercomputer with 8640 cores and a
peak performance of 0.1 petaflop called
`HPC-FF <http://www.fz-juelich.de/jsc/juropa/configuration/>`__.

Every year at the beginning of September the EU-IM members meet for the
EU-IM General Meeting to make the point on the advance status of the
projects, update about the projects different from their own and learn
how to use the new ISIP tools.
`Here <http://itm2010.eufus.eu/index.php>`__ it is possible to have a
look to previous year meetings to gather an idea about EU-IM activities

As regards organisation, EU-IM presents a Task Force Leader with 2 deputy
leaders, and a Project Leader with one or more deputy leader for every
IMP and for ISIP. Moreover the Gateway User Board, composed with the TFL
and the leader of every IMP as a representative of the IMP users,
determines the policy of Gateway administration. The EFDA-EU-IM project is
accountable to the EFDA steering committee and its CSU is Denis Kalupin.

Every researcher of a country associated to
`EURATOM <http://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/euratom/fusion/funding/index_en.htm>`__
is encouraged to cooperate with these projects. To do this the first
thing is to contact `the Contact Person at your Research
Unit <#itm_contact_list_2010>`__ who will, among other things, provide
you with the name(s) of the project leader(s) of the project(s) you are
interested in. People outside EURATOM Association interested in joining
the task-force need to contact the Task Force Leader. Their request will
be considered on an individual basis. The participation is ruled by EFDA
calls issued once every year and sent to HRU and Contact Persons. Next
call will be in November 2010.
