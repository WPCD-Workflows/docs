Getting support for the ITM platform and Gateway
------------------------------------------------

The ITM provides several ways to get support when you run into problems.
Which one to choose depends on the nature of your problem. This page
tries to give an overview.

Support for problems related to the ITM Gateway
-----------------------------------------------

The official documentation of the ITM Gateway can be found at
https://itm.ipp.mpg.de.

Please look here for how to report problems with the Gateway:
`https://itm.ipp.mpg.de/wiki/ITM/index.php/How_to_get_support\#Support_from_RZG <https://itm.ipp.mpg.de/wiki/ITM/index.php/How_to_get_support#Support_from_RZG>`__.

Support for problems related to the ITM Platform and Software
-------------------------------------------------------------

All ITM-specific software and the whole ITM platform is supported by the
Core Programming Team (CPT). You can submit trouble tickets to them via
the General Support Project in the GForge system. To get more effective
help, have a look at the guidelines prepared here: `How to report an
issue <http://portal.efda-itm.eu/twiki/bin/view/Main/HowToReportAnIssue>`__.

To directly submit a trouble ticket, go to: `General Support Tracker
(https://gforge6.eufus.eu/project/generalsupport/tracker/) <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/project/generalsupport/tracker/?action=TrackerItemAdd&tracker_id=184>`__.

Use this support tracker if your problem falls in the following
categories:

-  Problems using the UAL, FC2K, HPC2K or similar tools
-  Problems running Kepler or Kepler workflows
-  Visualization tools: VisIt, Python
-  Integrated Simulation Editor (ISE)
-  Any software project that is hosted in GForge
-  Any kind of scientific software

Feature requests for ITM Software
---------------------------------

Feature requests for software developed within the ITM can be submitted
to a separate tracker.

To submit a feature request, please go to `General Feature Request
Tracker <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/project/generalsupport/tracker/?action=TrackerItemBrowse&tracker_id=702>`__.

If you are unsure whether to file a bug report of feature request, have
