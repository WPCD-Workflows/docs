Workflows for Integrated Physics Modelling
------------------------------------------

There are currently two ETS workflows

-  ETS_A
-  ETS_C

For equilibrium reconstruction and MHD stability analysis the IMP12 has
developed a set of workflows `IMP12 workflows <imp12_workflows.html>`__

The IMP5 has developed a workflow combining all heating and current
schemes, the `IMP5HCD <imp5_compositeactor_imp5hcd.html>`__. This
workflow runs as a module in the ETS. For more workflows related to
heating current drive, see `IMP5 workflows <imp5_workflows.html>`__
