Visualization
=============

The EU-IM-TF employs a variety of tools to visualize results from
numerical simulations.

`EU-IM Visualization overview document
here <../../../isip/public/imports/itm-vis-roadmap2012.pdf>`__ (with
timeline & development plan).

General-purpose visualisation tools

-  ISE
   The Integrated Simulation Editor, ISE, allows to visualise and edit
   data from an EU-IM database entry. It also allows running a Kepler
   workflow based on the opened data entry.
-  Python
   Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language whose
   design philosophy emphasizes code readability. There are powerful
   visualisation packages for python, e.g. mathplotlib which provide an
   interface similar to the one provided by MATLAB. The EU-IM has also
   developed a python interface to the UAL and a python actor for
   Kepler.
   For an introduction to python visualization of EU-IM, see the
   Euforia training
-  VisIt
   VisIt is a free interactive parallel visualization and graphical
   analysis tool for viewing scientific data.

-  MATLAB
   MATLAB is an interpretative programming languish with a commersial
   engine. As of september 2011 there are MATLAB licences on the Gateway
   courtesy of ENEA.
   The EU-IM has developed a MATLAB interface to the UAL. An examples can
   be found on the gateway on the account of Olivier Sauter
