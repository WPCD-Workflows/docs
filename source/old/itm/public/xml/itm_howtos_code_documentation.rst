Guidelines for Code Documentation
=================================

UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

All released EU-IM codes should have two types of documentation:

-  Detailed documentation to be used during code development and
   maintainace.
   The code provider can choose how to generate this documentation, but
   the EU-IM recommends to use Doxygen.
   For instructions on how to use Doxygen see

   -  webpages on
      Using Doxygen with Fortran
   -  slides on
      Quick Introduction to Doxygen

   Example:
   Doxygen documentation for RFOF
-  Documentation that allow non experts to run the code. This
   documentation should include e.g. description of the input/output,
   the physics model used in the code and the limits of the
   applicability of the code.
