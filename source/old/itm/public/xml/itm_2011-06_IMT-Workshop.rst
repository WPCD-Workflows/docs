Talks given at the 2011-06 Integrated Modelling Technology Workshop
===================================================================

June 8-10, 2011

Cadarache, France

The ITER Integrated Modelling Analysis Suite (IMAS) is currently being
defined by a consortium including CEA, CRPP, Chalmers and Areva, under a
Contract with the ITER Physics and Operation Department. The consortium
has performed an initial capture of the requirements and is now seeking
input on potential technologies to help realize the ITER Integrated
Modelling Analysis Suite.

The aim of the workshop is to provide a broad review and discussion of
suitable existing or emerging technologies and to gain knowledge
insights in potential candidate technologies for the IMAS. In addition,
the initial IMAS requirement capture done by the Consortium may be
reviewed / extended from the discussions.

This workshop is organized jointly by ITER Organization and CEA/IRFM.
