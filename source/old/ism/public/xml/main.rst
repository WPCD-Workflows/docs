Scientific Rationale and Main Objectives
----------------------------------------

Integrated scenario modelling is essential for understanding the physics
of magnetically confined fusion plasmas, prediction and optimisation of
plasma performance. The main objectives of the ISM group within the EU-IM
TF are to provide support to:
- interpretative and predictive scenario modelling on existing EU
tokamaks addressing the physics and operational issues
- scenario modelling activities to cover the preparation of operational
scenario for ITER, JT60-SA, DEMO
ISM activities
--------------

ACT1: Support to the validation and physics application of the ETS and
EU-IM tools
ACT2: Interpretative and predictive scenario modelling on existing
devices
ACT3: Support to predictive scenario modelling for future devices (e.g.
JT60-SA, ITER, DEMO)
