Working Sessions
================

With the consolidation of the ITM-TF infrastructure and maturing tools,
there are inevitably some interdependencies in the workprogramme of the
integrated modelling projects. A new feature of the 2010 implementation
of the ITM-TF work programme is the focused use of coordinated joint
activities as integral part of the work. These joint activities will be
organised in working sessions and code camps (working sessions supported
by the integration team) and supported under mobility.

Control Meeting at Cadarache, 22-23 June
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The meeting was a kick-off meeting on the overall activities of the
ITM-TF focusing on plasma control. A particular emphasis on free
boundary equilibrium codes and position+shape control was given. The
need for multiplexer/de-multiplexer
actors
was highlighted in order to decouple the controller actors from any
detail of the
CPO
ontology, rendering the adaptation of control schemas much more
flexible. A tentative workflow schema for plasma current control was
produced. Foreseen obstacles for the coupling of feedback controlled
free boundary equilibrium codes to the ETS were highlighted taking the
learning curve from the DINA-CH+CRONOS package.

3D wall at Garching, 18 March
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The meeting was dedicated to assess the ongoing status of the
defeaturing tool, challenges on targeting real device CAD
representations of some devices and interfacing with the GRID CPO.

-  Minutes (R. Coelho)
-  Overview of ITM datastructure heading to 3D (R. Coelho)
-  3D defeaturing tool effort under the ITM (T.Lunt/S.Jämsä)
-  3D Meshing strategies guidelines in RWM codes (M. Palumbo)
-  Edge CPO and grid structuring (F. Subba)

Control Activities at Cadarache, 28 June - 1 July
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A joint working session and Code camp to discuss the ongoing activities
related to control on the ITM-TF (at both project and task level) and to
provide training with the first test cases of the Control Toolbox, for
SCICOS and SIMULINK born control diagrams. Simple PID cases suited
perfectly the training purpose and evidenced the valuable ongoing
effort. The timeline for fully integrating a free boundary equilibrium
code under feedback shape control was discussed. Improvements on the
kepler actor management methods and on the automation of the actor
creation from C code emanating from the SCICOS/SIMULINK diagrams were
discussed.

ERC3D integration on the ITM infrastructure, 5-6 July
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A working session promoted to discuss the integration of the ERC3D
reflectometer package on the ITM infrastructure. The discussion focused
on particular aspects of the datastructure that need to be developed, in
particular the Antenna and Output CPOs to be plugged to the code.
Meshing interfacing, code parameters and C interface were also
discussed.
