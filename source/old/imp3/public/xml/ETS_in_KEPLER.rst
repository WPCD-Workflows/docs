ETS workflows in KEPLER
=======================

The ETS workflow is used for 1-D transport simulation of a tokamak core
plasma.

**ETS workflows in KEPLER**:

-  use actors and composite actors from other IMPs, thus for the most
   recent versions of them please check with relevant project
-  complex, but clearly structured workflow, which offers user friendly
   interface for configuring the simulation
-  allow for easy modifications (
   connecting new modules, or reconnecting parts of the workflow
   ) through an easy graphical interface
-  provide users with all updates through the version control system
-  still in active development tool

There are currently 2 workflows being developed within EU-IM-IMP3 project:

-  ETS_A_4.10b
