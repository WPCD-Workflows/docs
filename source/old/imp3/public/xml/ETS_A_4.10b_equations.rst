EQUATIONS TO BE SOLVED AND BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
==============================================

Main Plasma
-----------

Before starting the run you need to select the type and value of the
boundary conditions for all equations. Please note that the value should
correspond to the type. All equations allow for following types of
boundary conditions:

-  OFF
   - equation is not solved, initial profiles will be kept for whole run
-  value
   - edge value should be specified
-  gradient
   - edge gradient should be specified
-  scale_length
   - edge scale length should be specified
-  generic
   - generic form:
   a1*yÂ´ + a2*y = a3
   of the boundary condition is assumed, 3 coefficients (
   a1
   ,
   a2
   ,
   a3
   ) should be provided
-  value_from_input_CPO
   - equation is solved, edge value evolution will be red from input
   shot
-  profile_from_input_CPO
   - equation is not solved, profile evolution will be red from input
   shot

The particular equation will be activated if the boundary condition type
for it is other than *OFF*

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box
   BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select
   Configure actor
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each equation
-  specify values for boundary conditions corresponding to the type and
   to the ion component
-  Commit

The workflow will not allow the user all particle components
(ions[1:NION]+electrons) to be run predictively. At least one of them
shall be set to OFF (this component will be computed from
quasi-neutrality condition).

!!! If electron density is solved, all ions with ni_bnd_type=OFF will be
computed from the quasineutrality condition and scaled proportional to
specified *ni_bnd_value* or inversely proportional to their charge,
*charge_proportional*. This is defined by option:
*ni_from_quasineutrality*.

Impurity
--------

You can set up the boundary conditions for impurity ions in a similar
way as for main ions. !!! Note, that at the moment only types: *OFF*;
*value* and *value_from_input_CPO* are accepter by impurity solver.

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box
   BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select
   Configure actor
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each impurity species (
   OFF
   -equation is not solved)
-  specify values for boundary density of each impurity component
   [1:MAX_Z_IMP]
   , separated by commas
-  Commit

Interface for impurity boundary condition has additional option,
*coronal_distribution*, that allow to preset the edge values or entire
profiles of individual ionization states from coronal distribution. In
tis case only single value is required to be specified for each impurity
boundary value. The options are:

-  OFF
   - the boundary values for impurity densities will be as they are
   specified above;
-  boundary_conditions
   - the boundary densities will be renormalized with corona, using the
   first element from above as a total density
-  boundary_conditions_and_profiles
   - the boundary densities and starting profiles will be renormalized
   with corona, using the first element from above as a total density

Neutrals
--------

!!! AT THE MOMENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR NEUTRAL VELOCITIES ARE
DISABLED, MIGHT BE ADDED ON REQUEST

Note, that ALL values should be specified in the order: {*1, 2, 3
...NION, 1, 2, 3, ...NIMP*}

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box
   BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select
   Configure actor
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each neutral species (
   OFF
   -equation is not solved)
-  specify values for boundary density and temperature of each neutral
   component
   [1, 2, 3 ...NION, 1, 2, 3, ...NIMP]

Input profiles interpolation
----------------------------

You are going to start the ETS run from some input shot, which might
contain some conflicting rho grids saved to different CPOs. Thus there
is a choice for the user to decide on the grid on which the starting
profiles should be load by the worflow,
*Interpolation_of_input_profiles*.

To define the interpolation grid select:

-  on_RHO_TOR_grid
   - interpolate input profiles based on the grid specyfied in [m];
-  on_RHO_TOR_NORM_grid
   - interpolate input profiles based on normalised rho grid [0:1]
