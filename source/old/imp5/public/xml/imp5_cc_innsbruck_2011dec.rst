.. _imp5_itm_cc_innsbruck_2011:

The participation of the IMP5 in the Innsbruck Code Camp was discussed
at the General Meeting in Garching. The preliminary plan is that the
IMP5 will participate both weeks of the Code Camp.

-  Week 1:
   Focus on integration with the aim of having as many as possible
   present to reach a critical mass of modellers so that we can help
   each other.
-  Week 2:
   Focus on integration into the ETS. Also integration will take place,
   but there will be fewer people there to ask for help.
