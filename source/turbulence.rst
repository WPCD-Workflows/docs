Turbulence with synthetic diagnostics workflows
###############################################
The turbulence with synthetic diagnostics workflows consist of the HESEL and RENATE actors for turbulence simulation and synthetic diagnostics.

*Brief description of HESEL.*

====================
HESEL as stand-alone
====================
HESEL can be run outside the workflow as a stand-alone code, where input are read from an input file and, optionally, from experimental data profiles. The output data are stored in a HDF5 datafile.

Obtaining and building HESEL
============================
The HESEL source code is currenty maintained in a private Github repository. For obtaining the source code please request access from ahnie@fysik.dtu.dk.

The following recipe describes how to load and build HESEL on the EUROfusion Gateway infrastructure.
