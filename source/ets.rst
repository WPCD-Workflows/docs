You can checkout the FORTRAN ETS workflow from gforge `/ project
ETS <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/>`__ following instructions
from `ETS User
Guide <../imports/ETS_Documentation/ETS_User_Guide.pdf>`__

If you did not use ETS before, first you need to request access to the
code via the `EFDA EU-IM Portal <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/>`__ by
following the GForge tab, following the `project
ETS <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/>`__ and requesting access.

Once you have access to the code, it can be checked out of SVN using

.. code-block:: console

   svn co https://gforge6.eufus.eu/svn/ets

to access the whole repository, or

.. code-block:: console

   svn co https://gforge6.eufus.eu/svn/ets/trunk/ETS

to access just the trunk version of the ETS.

The `ETS project on Gforge <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/>`__
also includes:

-  `A wiki <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/wiki/>`__
-  `Some documentation <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/docman/>`__
-  `Trackers <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/tracker/>`__
-  `News <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/news/>`__
-  `Mailing lists <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/mailman/>`__
-  `The SVN repository (web interface) <https://gforge6.eufus.eu/gf/project/ets/scmsvn/>`__

===============================================================================================
Roadmap for the ETS verification and benchmarking procedure (based on G. Pereverzev's proposal)
===============================================================================================

-  Proposal for ETS verification and benchmarking procedure (PDF)
-  ETS verification and benchmarking (ASTRA results) (PDF)

================================================
Part I. Cylindrical geometry. Consistency check.
================================================

==============================================
Results obtained in 2011 for UAL-version 4.08b
==============================================

NOTE: For the particle diffusion coefficient D and pinch velocity v, the
values below correspond in fact to the individual coefficients for each of
the three transport models considered within ETS. For example, a v=1
translates into an effective pinch velocity of 3 in the density transport
equation and of 0+3/2+5/2=4 in the ion flux contributing to heat transport.

ETS workflows in KEPLER
***********************

The ETS workflow is used for 1-D transport simulation of a tokamak core
plasma.

**ETS workflows in KEPLER**:

-  use actors and composite actors from other IMPs, thus for the most
   recent versions of them please check with relevant project
-  complex, but clearly structured workflow, which offers user friendly
   interface for configuring the simulation
-  allow for easy modifications (connecting new modules, or reconnecting
   parts of the workflow) through an easy graphical interface
-  provide users with all updates through the version control system
-  still in active development tool

There are currently 2 workflows being developed within EU-IM-IMP3 project:

-  ETS_A_4.10b Contact person: Denis Kalupin 
-  ETS_A_4.10a Contact person: Denis Kalupin

Installing the ETS
------------------

The default ETS release is the tag4.10b10.3

**Before installation make sure that:**

-  you have your private data base for the version of the
   UAL
   required by the workflow
-  you have the version of
   KEPLER
   required by the workflow installed. Quick start on kepler required
   for the ETS can be found
   here
-  inside the window, where you will be downloading the ETS the source
   command:

.. code-block:: console

   >source $EU-IMSCRIPTDIR/EU-IMv1 Kepler_Version Data_Base_Name UAL_Version
            
is executed.

**To install your local copy of the ETS workflow please do:**

.. code-block:: console

   >svn co https://gforge6.eufus.eu/svn/keplerworkflows/tags/ets_4.10b10.3/ETS
   >cd ETS
   >make import_ets

Press the play button on the workflow.

**The workflow shall run!** If it
does not, please use the contact from above.

**Starting the workflow:**
If you have the workflow already installed, there are there are several
ways tio execute it:

-  For execution via kepler GUI:
   
.. code-block:: console
                
      >kepler.sh workflow_path/workflow_name.xml
          

-  For execution in none GUI mode:

.. code-block:: console

      >kepler.sh -runwf -nogui -redirectgui $EU-IMHOME/some_dir_name workflow_path/workflow_name.xml
          

-  For execution in batch mode:
   it is essential to keep the workflow inside your $EU-IMWORK area

   it is essential to switch to scripts/R2.2 module

.. code-block:: console

      >module switch scripts/R2.2
      >submit_batch_kepler.sh run_dircetory 1 $EU-IMWORK/workflow_path/workflow_name.xml $EU-IMSCRIPTDIR/batch_submission/ParallelKepler.bsub

.. _ETS_A_4.10b_equations:

Equations to be solved and boundary conditions
----------------------------------------------

Main Plasma
~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the run you need to select the type and value of the
boundary conditions for all equations. Please note that the value should
correspond to the type. All equations allow for following types of
boundary conditions:

-  OFF
   - equation is not solved, initial profiles will be kept for whole run
-  value
   - edge value should be specified
-  gradient
   - edge gradient should be specified
-  scale_length
   - edge scale length should be specified
-  generic
   - generic form:
   a1*y´ + a2*y = a3
   of the boundary condition is assumed, 3 coefficients (a1, a2, a3) should be provided
-  value_from_input_CPO
   - equation is solved, edge value evolution will be red from input
   shot
-  profile_from_input_CPO
   - equation is not solved, profile evolution will be red from input
   shot

The particular equation will be activated if the boundary condition type
for it is other than *OFF*

.. figure:: images/ets_run_settings3.png
   :align: center
           

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select **Configure actor**
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each equation
-  specify values for boundary conditions corresponding to the type and
   to the ion component
-  **Commit**

The workflow will not allow the user all particle components
(ions[1:NION]+electrons) to be run predictively. At least one of them shall
be set to OFF (this component will be computed from quasi-neutrality
condition).

!!! If electron density is solved, all ions with ni_bnd_type=OFF will be
computed from the quasineutrality condition and scaled proportional to
specified *ni_bnd_value* or inversely proportional to their charge,
*charge_proportional*. This is defined by option:
*ni_from_quasineutrality*.

Impurity
~~~~~~~~

You can set up the boundary conditions for impurity ions in a similar
way as for main ions. !!! Note, that at the moment only types: *OFF*;
*value* and *value_from_input_CPO* are accepter by impurity solver.

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select **Configure actor**
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each impurity species (
   OFF-equation is not solved)
-  specify values for boundary density of each impurity component
   [1:MAX_Z_IMP], separated by commas
-  **Commit**

.. figure:: images/ets_run_settings4.png
   :align: center

Interface for impurity boundary condition has additional option,
*coronal_distribution*, that allow to preset the edge values or entire
profiles of individual ionization states from coronal distribution. In tis
case only single value is required to be specified for each impurity
boundary value. The options are:

-  OFF
   - the boundary values for impurity densities will be as they are
   specified above;
-  boundary_conditions
   - the boundary densities will be renormalized with corona, using the
   first element from above as a total density
-  boundary_conditions_and_profiles
   - the boundary densities and starting profiles will be renormalized
   with corona, using the first element from above as a total density

Neutrals
~~~~~~~~

!!! AT THE MOMENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR NEUTRAL VELOCITIES ARE DISABLED,
MIGHT BE ADDED ON REQUEST

Note, that ALL values should be specified in the order: {*1, 2, 3 ...NION, 1, 2, 3, ...NIMP*}

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select **Configure actor**
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each neutral species (OFF-equation is not solved)
-  specify values for boundary density and temperature of each neutral component
   [1, 2, 3 ...NION, 1, 2, 3, ...NIMP], separated by commas
- **Commit**

Input profiles interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are going to start the ETS run from some input shot, which might
contain some conflicting rho grids saved to different CPOs. Thus there is a
choice for the user to decide on the grid on which the starting profiles
should be load by the worflow,

.. _ETS_A_4.10b_convergence:

Convergence loop
----------------

ETS updates input from different physics actors in a sequence, which is
finished by solving the transport equations. Ther are possible
none-linear couplings between different parts of the system. These
nonelinearities are trited by the ETS using iterations. The decision to
step in time is made by the ETS based on the criteria that the maximum
relative deviation of main plasma profiles is lower than some predefined
tolerance. There is a number of settings and sitches in the ETS that are
used by the iterative scheme. To edit them do:

-  right click on the box CONVERGENCE LOOP
-  select **Configure actor** to edit settings
-  choose your settings
-  **Commit**

.. figure:: images/ets_convergence1.png
   :align: center

Switches in the field *FREQUENCY OF CALLING THE PHYSICS ACTORS* define
how many times the the actors of a certain cathegory (equilibrium,
transport, etc.) should be called in a single time step.
By selecting *YES* all actors of this cathegory will be called every iteration
By selecting *NO* all actors of this cathegory will be called only ones in
a time step

Switches and parameters in the field *CONTROL PARAMETERS* define how
iterations are done

-  Tolerance - defines the maximum relative error of profiles change compared to
   previous iteration. If it is achieved the time steping is done.

For highly none-linear case the required precision can be achieved
faster by the iterative scheme if only fraction of the new solution is
mixed to the previous state.
The following scheme is adopted by the ets to reduce none-linearities in profiles, transport coefficients and
sources:

.. code-block:: console

   Y = (Amix * Y+) + ((1-Amix)*Y-)

where Amix is the mixing fraction You can activate the mixing of
profiles, transport coefficient and sources by selecting the
corresponding *Mixing_fraction_...* to be between [0:1]
You also can activate the authomatic ajustment of this fraction by selecting:
*Ajust_Mixing_for_...* to *YES*

.. _ETS_A_4.10b_equilibrium:

Equilibrium
-----------

Initialization Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the run you need to set up your initial equlibrium.
There are several options to do it: if your input shot contains the
consistent equilibrium with all necessary parameters - you can start
immediately from it; if your input shot contains the equilibrium but it
is not consistent or some parameters are missing you can check it
automatically; if your input equilibrium is corrupt or not present - you
can define the starting equlinbrium by tree moment description. To
select your starting equilibrium please do:

-  right click on the box BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION
-  select **Configure actor** to edit settings
-  Select your settings or specify values
-  **Commit**

.. figure:: images/ets_before_time.png

.. figure:: images/ets_run_settings7.png
   :align: center
   
Please note, that different equilibrium solvers might require slightly
different input. Thus it is a user responsibility to check that the
information inside input shot/run is enough to run selected equilibrium
solver.

Run Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several equilibrium solvers connected to the ETS. You can
select the one of them.Therefore please do:

-  right click on the box CONVERGENCE LOOP
-  select **Open actor**
-  right click on the box EQUILIBRIUM
-  select **Configure actor** to edit settings
-  choose your equilibrium solver
-  **Commit**

.. figure:: images/ets_convergence_loop_config.png
   :align: center

*INTERPRETATIVE* means that the ETS will not update the equilibrium,
instead it will be using the initial equilibrium.

Please note, that it is better to select the same code as you used for
pre-iterrations. Because outputs of different equilibrium solver are not
necessary done with the same resolution. Therefore the routine saving
the information to the data base might brake due to uncompatible sizes
of some signals.

Transport models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ETS constructs the total transport coefficients from the combination of
Anomalous transport (model choice), Neoclassical transport (model
choice), Database transport (transport coefficients be saved to the
input shot) and Background transport (Transport coefficients defined
through the GUI interface)

D_tot = D_DB*M_DB + D_AN*M_AN + D_NC*M_NC + D_BG*M_BG

You should choose from the list of evailable models in each cathegory or
switch it **OFF**

Individual multipliers for all channels shall be specified on the lower
level through the code parameters of Transport Combiner

The list of available transport models can be found
`here <https://www.eufus.eu/documentation/EU-IM/html/ets_status.html>`__.

.. figure:: images/ets_transport2.png
   :align: center
           
Background transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add the constant background level for each coefficient (ion and
impurity coefficients are expected to be the strings of [1:NION] and
[1:NIMP] elements respectively, separated by commas)

.. figure:: images/ets_transport3.png
   :align: center


Edge transport barrier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section you can artificially supress the transport outside of
specified *RHO_TOR_NORM_ETB*. Total transport coefficients for all
transport channels (ne, ni, nz, Te, Ti,...) will be reduced to constant
values specified below (ion and impurity coefficients are expected to be
the strings [1:NION] and [1:NIMP] respectively)

.. figure:: images/ets_transport4.png
   :align: center

Total transport coefficients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fine tuning of of transport coefficients can be done through editing
the XML code parameters of the **transport combiner** actor:

-  In Outline browse for transportcombiner
-  select **Configure actor**
-  click **Edit Code Parameters**
-  

   -  If you select **OFF** contributions from all transport models to this channel will be
      nullified;
   -  If you select **Multipliers_for_contributions_from** the transport channel
      will be activated, and the total transport coefficient will be
      combined from active tranport models. You gust need to specify
      multiplier against each channel;
   -  For convective velocity there is an additional option
      **V_over_D_ratio_for_contributions_from**.
      With this option selected the combiner will ignore the
      convective components provided by transport models. The convective
      velocity will be determined from the diffusion coefficient by
      applying fixed V/D ratio (
      for inward pinch the values should be negative!
      ).

The detailed information on initial IMP5HCD settings can be found
`here <https://www.eufus.eu/documentation/EU-IM/html/imp5_imp5hcd.html>`__.
Please note that settings for NBI are done independent for each PINI.
Therefore, for NBI settings, please insert the values separated by
commas. The number of the element in the array corresponds to the number
of activated PINI. Maximum accepted number of PINIs = 16.

.. figure:: images/ets_sources5.png
   :align: center

Power control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You also can activate the power control for the IMP5HCD sources.

.. figure:: images/ets_sources6.png
   :align: center

If the POWER_CONTROL is not **OFF**, there are two modes of
operation: **specific** and **frequency**

For **specific** you should specify the time sequence separated by commas
and the corresponding power sequence (where first power level
corresponds to the first time, second to second and etc.). Linear
interpolation will be done between the sequence points. For example: if
you give the power **sequence** = 2e6,4e6,1e6 and **times** = 0.0, 0.7, 1.5 (s) the delivered power would be:

.. figure:: images/ets_sources7.png
   :align: center

For **frequency** you should specify the power levels sequence separated
by commas, start and end time of the power control and the frequency of
switching between these levels. For example: if you give the power
**sequence** = 2e6,4e6,1e6 and **frequency** = 10 (Hz) **tstart** = 0.0 (s)
**tend** = 1.5 (s) the delivered power would be:

.. figure:: images/ets_sources8.png
   :align: center

Total power
~~~~~~~~~~~

Profiles of the total source for each channel are obtained from the the
individual contributions (Data Base, Gaussian, Neutrals, Impurity and
HCD) as a summ of all activated sources multiplied with coefficients
specified on the interface of the composite actor.

S_tot = S_DS*DSM + S_GS*GSM + S_Neu*NeuSM + S_IMP*IMPSM + S_HCD*HCDSM

The fine tuning of of sources can be done through editing the XML code
parameters of the source combiner actor:

-  In the Outline browse for source combiner
-  select **Configure actor**
-  click **Edit Code Parameters**
-  If you like the sources to the particular equation being activated -
   select **from_input_CPOs**, and then, put the multipliers against each
   contribution; if you select **OFF** contributions from all sources to
   this channel will be nullified.

.. _ETS_A_4.10a_equations:

Equations to be solved and boundary conditions
----------------------------------------------

Main plasma
~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the run you need to select the type and value of the
boundary conditions for all equations. Please note that the value should
correspond to the type. All equations allow for following types of
boundary conditions:

-  OFF
   - equation is not solved, initial profiles will be kept for whole run
-  value
   - edge value should be specified
-  gradient
   - edge gradient should be specified
-  scale_length
   - edge scale length should be specified
-  generic
   - 3 coefficients (a1,a2,a3) should be provided: a1*y´ + a2*y = a3
-  value_from_input_CPO
   - equation is solved, edge value evolution will be red from input
   shot
-  profile_from_input_CPO
   - equation is not solved, profile evolution will be red from input
   shot

The particular equation will be activated if the boundary condition type
for it is other than *OFF*!

.. figure:: images/ets_run_boundary_a.png
   :align: center 

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box ‘BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION’
-  select ‘Configure actor’
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each equation
-  specify values for boundary conditions corresponding to the type and
   to the ion component
-  Commit

!!! If electron density is solved, all ions with ni_bnd_type=OFF will be
computed from the quasineutrality condition and scaled proportional to
specified *ni_bnd_value* or inversely proportional to their charge
*(charge_proportional)*. This is defined by option:
*ni_from_quasineutrality*.

Impurity
~~~~~~~~

You can set up the boundary conditions for impurity ions in a similar
way as for main ions. !!! Note, that at the moment only types: *OFF*;
*value* and *value_from_input_CPO* are accepter by impurity solver.

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box ‘BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION’
-  select ‘Configure actor’
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each impurity species
   (OFF-equation is not solved)
-  specify values for boundary density of each impurity component
   [1:MAX_Z_IMP], separated by commas
-  Commit
   
.. figure:: images/ets_run_boundary2_a.png
   :align: center 

   
Interface for impurity boundary condition has additional option ,
*coronal_distribution*, that allow to preset the edge values or entire
profiles of individual ionization states from coronal distribution. In
tis case only single value is required to be specified for each impurity
boundary value. The options are:

-  OFF
   - the boundary values for impurity densities will be as they are
   specified above;
-  boundary_conditions
   - the boundary densities will be renormalized with corona, using the
   first element from above as a total density
-  boundary_conditions_and_profiles
   - the boundary densities and starting profiles will be renormalized
   with corona, using the first element from above as a total density

Neutrals
~~~~~~~~

!!! AT THE MOMENT BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR NEUTRAL VELOCITIES ARE
DISABLED, MIGHT BE ADDED ON REQUEST

Note, that ALL values should be specified in the order: *{1, 2, 3
...NION, 1, 2, 3, ...NIMP}*

To set up boundary conditions:

-  right click on the box ‘BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION’
-  select ‘Configure actor’
-  select appropriate boundary condition for each neutral species
   (OFF-equation is not solved)
-  specify values for boundary density and temperature of each neutral
   component [1, 2, 3 ...NION, 1, 2, 3, ...NIMP], separated by commas

Input Profiles Interpolation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are going to start the ETS run from some input shot, which might
contain some conflicting rho grids. Thus there is a choice for the user
to decide on the grid on which the starting profiles should be load by
the worflow, *Interpolation_of_input_profiles*.

To define the interpolation grid select:

-  on_RHO_TOR_grid
   - interpolate input profiles based on the grid specyfied in [m];
-  on_RHO_TOR_NORM_grid
   - interpolate input profiles based on normalised rho grid [0:1]

.. figure:: images/ets_run_boundary5_a.png
   :align: center 

.. _ETS_A_4.10a_convergence:

Convergence loop
----------------

ETS updates input from different physics actors in a sequence, which is
finished by solving the transport equations. Ther are possible none-linear
couplings between different parts of the system. These nonelinearities are
trited by the ETS using iterations. The decision to step in time is made by
the ETS based on the criteria that the maximum relative deviation of main
plasma profiles is lower than some predefined tolerance. There is a number
of settings and sitches in the ETS that are used by the iterative scheme.
To edit them do:

-  right click on the box ‘CONVERGENCE LOOP’
-  select ‘Configure actor’ to edit settings
-  choose your settings
-  Commit

.. figure:: images/ets_convergence1_a.png
   :align: center 
   
Switches in the field *FREQUENCY OF CALLING THE PHYSICS ACTORS* define how
many times the the actors of a certain cathegory (equilibrium, transport,
etc.) should be called in a single time step. By selecting *YES* all actors
of this cathegory will be called every iteration By selecting *NO* all
actors of this cathegory will be called only ones in a time step

Switches and parameters in the field *CONTROL PARAMETERS* define how
iterations are done

-  Tolerance
   - defines the maximum relative error of profiles change compared to
   previous iteration. If it is achieved the time steping is done.

For highly none-linear case the required precision can be achieved faster
by the iterative scheme if only fraction of the new solution is mixed to
the previous state. The following scheme is adopted by the ets to reduce
none-linearities in profiles, transport coefficients and sources:

.. code-block:: console

   Y = (Amix * Y+) + ((1-Amix)*Y-)

where Amix is the mixing fraction You can activate the mixing of profiles,
transport coefficient and sources by selecting the corresponding
*Mixing_fraction_...* to be between [0:1] You also can activate the
authomatic ajustment of this fraction by selecting: *Ajust_Mixing_for_...*
to *YES*

.. _ETS_A_4.10a_equilibrium:

Equilibrium
-----------

Starting Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the run you need to set up your initial equlibrium. There
are several options to do it: if your input shot contains the consistent
equilibrium with all necessary parameters - you can start immediately from
it; if your input shot contains the equilibrium but it is not consistent or
some parameters are missing you can check it automatically; if your input
equilibrium is corrupt or not present - you can define the starting
equlinbrium by tree moment description. To select your starting equilibrium
please do:

-  right click on the box ‘BEFORE THE TIME EVOLUTION’
-  select ‘Configure actor’ to edit settings
-  Select your settings or specify values
-  Commit
   
.. figure:: images/ets_eq_a.png
   :align: center 
   
SETTINGS:

-  Equilibrium_configuration
   - select
   configure_manually
   if you like to specify configuration below; select
   from_input_CPO

-  Triangularity_lower
   - lower triangularity of the LCMS [-]
-  Equilibrium code
   - select one of available equilibrium solvers to check the
   consistency between starting equilibrium and current profile; use
   INTERPRETATIVE
   if you trust your input data (in this case the check will be
   ignorred).

.. figure:: images/ets_eq2_a.png
   :align: center 

Please note, that different equilibrium solvers might require slightly
different input. Thus it is a user responsibility to check that the
information inside input shot/run is enough to run selected equilibrium
solver.

Run Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several equilibrium solvers connected to the ETS. You can
select the one of them.Therefore please do:

-  right click on the box ‘CONVERGENCE LOOP’
-  select ‘Open actor’
-  right click on the box ‘EQUILIBRIUM’
-  select ‘Configure actor’ to edit settings
-  choose your equilibrium solver
-  Commit

.. figure:: images/ets_eq3_a.png
   :align: center 
   
*INTERPRETATIVE* means that the ETS will not update the equilibrium,
instead it will be using the initial equilibrium.

Please note, that it is better to select the same code as you used for
pre-iterrations. Because outputs of different equilibrium solver are not
necessary done with the same resolution. Therefore the routine saving
the information to the data base might brake due to uncompatible sizes
of some signals.

.. _ETS_A_4.10a_transport:

Transport
---------

The settings for TRANSPORT can be done inside the CONVERGENCE LOOP
composite actor. Therefore please do:

Choice of transport model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ETS constructs the total transport coefficients from the combination of
Anomalous transport (model choice), Neoclassical transport (model
choice) and Database transport (transport coefficients be saved to the
input shot)

.. code-block:: console

   D_tot = D_DB*M_DB + D_AN*M_AN + D_NC*M_NC 

You should choose from the list of evailable models in each cathegory or
switch it OFF

The list of available transport models can be found
`here <https://www.eufus.eu/documentation/EU-IM/html/ets_status.html>`__.

.. figure:: images/ets_transport2_a.png
   :align: center

Main plasma transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section you define how total transport coefficients for main
ions should be constructed from contributions provided by different
models. You need to provide the multipliers for Anomalous, Neoclassical
and Database contributions, which will determine their weights in total
transport coefficient.

You also can add the constant background level for each coefficient (ion
coefficients are expected to be the string {1:NION}, separated by
commas)

.. figure:: images/ets_transport3_a.png
   :align: center

Impurity transport
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section you define how total transport coefficients for impurity
ions should be constructed from contributions provided by different
models. You need to provide the multipliers for Anomalous, Neoclassical
and Database contributions, which will determine their weights in total
transport coefficient.

You also can add the constant background level for each coefficient
(coefficients are expected to be the string {1:NIMP}, separated by
commas)

In addition, there is an option to import the Anomalous component of
transport coefficient *from_first_ion* or *from_electrons* (the same
anomalous contribution will be added to all impurity components, all
ionization states)

.. figure:: images/ets_transport4_a.png
   :align: center

Edge transport barrier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section you can artificially supress the transport outside of
specified *RHO_TOR_NORM_ETB*. Total transport coefficients for all
transport channels (ne, ni, nz, Te, Ti,...) will be reduced to constant
values specified below (ion and impurity coefficients are expected to be
the strings {1:NION}) and {1:NIMP} respectively)

.. figure:: images/ets_transport5_a.png
   :align: center

Total transport coefficients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Profiles of the total transport coefficient for each channel are
obtained from the the individual contributions (Data Base, Anomalous,
Neoclassical and Background) as a summ of all activated transport models
multiplied with coefficients specified on the interface of the composite
actor.

.. code-block:: console

   X_tot = X_DB*DBM + X_AN*ANM + X_NC*NCM + X_BG*BGM  

!!! Note, that contributions to all transport equations will be
multiplied with the same value. For example: if
AnomalousTransportMultiplier=3.0, then contibutions from selected
anomalous transport model to each transport equation will be multiplied
with 3.0

The fine tuning of of transport coefficients can be done through editing
the XML code parameters of the transport combiner actor:

-  right click on the box ‘TRANSPORT’
-  select ‘Open actor’ to edit settings
-  right click on the box ‘Transport Combiner’
-  select ‘Open actor’ to edit settings
-  right click on the box ‘transportcombiner’
-  select ‘Configure actor’
-  click ‘Edit Code Parameters’
-  If you select *OFF* contributions from all transport models to this
   channel will be nullified; If you select *from_input_CPOs* the
   transport channel will be activated, and the total transport
   coefficient will be combined from active tranport models; For
   convective velocity there is an additional option
   *fixed_V_over_D_ratio*, by selecting this the combiner will ignore
   the convective components provided by transport nmodels. The
   convective velocity will be determined from the total diffusion
   coefficient by applying fixed V/D ratio (*for inward pinch the values
   should be negative!*). For all active channels you can adjust
   multipliers for combining contributions from different transport
   models (array of four space separated values is expected):

   -  first position - Data Base transport coefficients;
   -  second position – Anomalous transport coefficients;
   -  third position – Neoclassical transport coefficients;
   -  fourth position – Background (constant level) transport
      coefficients;

Power control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You also can activate the power control for the IMP5HCD sources.

.. figure:: images/ets_sources6_a.png
   :align: center

If the POWER_CONTROL is not *OFF*, there are two modes of
operation:\ *specific* and *frequency*

For *specific* you should specify the time sequence separated by commas
and the corresponding power sequence (where first power level
corresponds to the first time, second to second and etc.). Linear
interpolation will be done between the sequence points. For example: if
you give the power sequence = 2e6,4e6,1e6 and times = 0.0, 0.7, 1.5 (s)
the delivered power would be:

.. figure:: images/ets_sources7_a.png
   :align: center

For *frequency* you should specify the power levels sequence separated
by commas, start and end time of the power control and the frequency of
switching between these levels. For example: if you give the power
sequence = 2e6,4e6,1e6 and frequency = 10 (Hz) tstart =0.0 (s) tend =
1.5 (s) the delivered power would be:

.. figure:: images/ets_sources8_a.png

Profiles of the total source for each channel are obtained from the the
individual contributions (Data Base, Gaussian, Neutrals, Impurity and
HCD) as a summ of all activated sources multiplied with coefficients
specified on the interface of the composite actor.

::

   S_tot = S_DS*DSM + S_GS*GSM + S_Neu*NeuSM + S_IMP*IMPSM + S_HCD*HCDSM 

!!! Note, that contributions to all transport equations will be
multiplied with the same value. For example: if

-  right click on the box ‘sourcecombiner’
-  select ‘Configure actor’
-  click ‘Edit Code Parameters’
-  If you like the sources to the particular equation being activated -
   select *from_input_CPOs*; if you select *OFF* contributions from all
   sources to this channel will be nullified. For active channels you
   can adjust multipliers for combining contributions from different
   source modules (array of five space separated values is expected):

   -  first position - Data Base sources;
   -  second position – Gaussian sources;
   -  third position – HCD sources;
   -  fourth position – Neutral sources;
   -  fifth position – Impurity sources.

.. _ETS_A_4.10a_inst_events:

Instantaneous events
--------------------

At the moment, user can swith ON and OFF two types of events: PELLET and
SAWTOOTH

Pellet
~~~~~~

At the top level of the workflow you can configure times for pellet
injection

-  right click on the box ‘INSTANTANEOUS EVENTS’
-  select ‘Configure actor’ to edit settings
-  Select Pellet_injection ‘ON’ if you like to use pellet in your
   simulation
-  Select mode of operation: ‘specific’ - pellets will be shut at
   specific times, you also need to specify array ‘times_pellet’

   -  ‘specific’ - pellets will be shut at exact times specified in
      array ‘times_pellet’
   -  ‘frequency’ – pellets will be shut from ‘tstart_pellet’ until
      ‘tend_pellet’ with a ’frequency_pellet’

-  ‘frequency’ – pellets will be shut from ‘tstart_pellet’ until
   ‘tend_pellet’ with a ’frequency_pellet’

Parameters of individual pellet need to be configured through the
icode_parameters of the PELLET actor. To access it go to 'Outline' on
the right upper corner and open the following:

.. figure:: images/eps_instantaneous_events2_a.png

-  right click on the actor ‘PELLET’
-  select ‘Configure actor’
-  click ‘Edit Code Parameters’
-  edit parameters and click ‘save and exit’

*amn* – atomic mass number: array of elements separated by space
(1:nelements) [-]

*zn* – nuclear charge: array of elements separated by space
(1:nelements) [-]

*fraction* – fraction of each element in the pellet, based on the number
of atoms: array of elements separated by space (1:nelements) [-]

*rpell* – radius of the pellet [m]

*vpell* – velocity of the pellet [m/s]

*rcloud* – radius of the pellet cloud [m], radial extension of the cloud
= 2*rp0

*lcloud* – length of the pellet cloud along the field line [m]

*Tcloud* – temperature of the pellet cloud [eV]

Pellet path is specified by two points, for which R and Z coordinated
should be specified

*R* – R coordinates of the pivot and second points of the pellet path,
separated by space [m]

*Z* – Z coordinates of the pivot and second points of the pellet path,
separated by space [m]

Control switches allow to activate:

-  drifts
   - YES - will activate radial displacement of deposition profile, same
   for all path points
-  cooling
   - YES - will activate cooling of the other side of the plasma due to
   parallel heat transport (essential for large pellets, which might
   cross the same flux surface twice)
-  JINTRAC
   - YES - will provide temperature reduction consistent with the model
   used in JETTO

MHD
~~~

At the top level of the workflow you can switch ON/OFF possible MHD
events

-  right click on the box ‘INSTANTANEOUS EVENTS’
-  select ‘Configure actor’ to edit settings
-  Select SAWTOOTH ‘ON’ if you like to use them in your simulation
-  Commit

.. _ETS_A_4.10a_visualization:

Visualization during the run
----------------------------

There is a number tools visualizing the ETS run.

Multiple Tab Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The display appeares automaticaly when the ETS workflow is launched. It
displays diagnostic text messages from the workflow on following topics:

-  Input data statement
-  Iterations to check the initial convergence between EQUILIBRIUM and
   CURRENT
-  Time evolution
-  Convergence of iteratinos within the time step
-  IMP5HCD settings
-  Power used by IMP5HCD actors durung the run

Also the error messages from execution of the workflow will be displayed
here.

Python Visualization Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can activate the graphical visualization of your run evolution:

-  right click on the box ‘Check Time & Save Slice’
-  select ‘Configure actor’
-  select visualisation ‘YES’ or ‘NO’
-  Commit

.. _ETS_C_KEPLER:

=====
ETS_C
=====

The ETS workflow (IMP3-ACT1) is used for 1-D transport simulation of a
tokamak core plasma.

**ETS workflow in KEPLER**:

-  uses as actors and composite actors from other IMPs, thus for the
   most recent versions of them please check with relevant project
-  complex, but clearly structured workflow, which offers user friendly
   interface for configuring the simulation
- allows for easy modifications (connecting new modules, or reconnecting
   the parts of the workflow) through the easy graphical interface
-  provides users with all updates through the version control system
-  still actively developing tool
