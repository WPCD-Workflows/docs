EU-IM new Gateway, please read `Announcements
page <#itm_announcements>`__.

The Integrated Tokamak Modeling Task Force (EU-IM-TF) was set up in 2004
with the long term aim to provide the EU with a suite of codes necessary
for preparing and analyzing future ITER discharges, with the highest
degree of flexibility, confidence and reliability. In brief: Aims:

-  Coordinate the development of a coherent set of validated simulation
   tools
-  Benchmark these tools on existing tokamak experiments
-  Provide a comprehensive simulation package for ITER and DEMO plasmas

Remit:

-  Coordinate the necessary software development with the goal of
   minimizing parallel efforts on the European level
-  Development of the necessary standardized software tools for
   interfacing code modules and accessing experimental data

Medium term activities:

-  Support the development of ITER-relevant scenarios in current
   experiments
-  Initiate a comprehensive
   Verification
   and
   Validation
   activity for the EU-IM-TF tools

Publications
============

EU-IM publication policy Any manuscript intended for circulation outside
the Task Force which is based on EU-IM related work has to be cleared by
the Task Force Leader. In line with the EFDA Publication Rules, the
following procedure applies: All proposed publications, conference
contributions and abstracts need to be endorsed by the Project Leader(s)
under whose project(s) the main part of the work to be reported was
carried out. The manuscripts, abstracts, presentations and posters must
then be submitted to the TF leadership at least 14 days prior to
submission deadline for review. Whenever EU-IM tools/infrastructure were
used to produce the work, please add to the authors list "and EU-IM-TF
contributors*" \*See the Appendix to the paper of G. Falchetto et al.,
Nucl. Fus. submitted. Similarly for ISM related publications please add
to the authors list "and the EU-EU-IM ITER Scenario Modelling group". The
explicit names of the corresponding authors should be used whenever they
actually contributed to the delivery of the work. Please include the
following Acknowledgments whenever part of the work was performed within
the EU-IM-TF Workprogramme. Acknowledgments This work, supported by the
European Communities under the contract of Association between EURATOM-
(association name) was (partly) carried out within the framework of the
Task Force on Integrated Tokamak Modelling of the European Fusion
Development Agreement. The views and opinions expressed herein do not
necessarily reflect those of the European Commission. The current list
