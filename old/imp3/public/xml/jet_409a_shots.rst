JET 4.09a shots
===============

Following simulations are available for JET machine in UAL 4.09a:

The shots can be accessed by setting

::

   TOKAMAKNAME = jet

   UAL = 4.09a

The following table lists the shot by shot number and run number
together with the list of stored CPOs, the user name of the data base,
and a short description.
