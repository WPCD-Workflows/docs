Meetings
========

The EDRG group, as most of the EU-IM projects, holds meetings that aim at
monitoring the internal progress on the EDRG tasks. In addition,
meetings are organized (mostly via VC) whenever experts from the
Experimentalist and Diagnosticians community or other representatives of
the european fusion devices engaged in the EU-IM activities require
assistance from the EU-IM in EDRG related activities. This is particularly
relevant for the development of the Machine Descriptions and Data
Mappings and for the integration of synthetic diagnostics. A list of all
the relevant meetings that took place in 2009 and 2010 is found below.
