Integrated Simulation Editor (ISE)
==================================

The Integrated Simulation Editor ISE allows to visualise and edit data
from an EU-IM database entry. It also allows running a Kepler workflow
based on the opened data entry. ISE is launched by simply typing ``ise``
in a terminal. A short ISE tutorial can be found
`here <../imports/isip_IntroductionISE.pdf>`__.
