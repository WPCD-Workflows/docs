EU-IM-TF Structure
================

The EFDA EU-IM-TF was structured into four Integrated Modelling Projects
(IMPs) focusing on the following physics areas:

-  IMP12
   plasma equilibrium and MHD
-  IMP3
   transport code and whole discharge evolution
-  IMP4
   transport and micro-instabilities
-  IMP5
   heating, current drive (H&CD) and fast particles

The "Infrastructure and Software Integration Project" (
ISIP
) was in charge of developing, maintaining and operating the code
platform structure and implementing the EU-IM data-structure. A key
function of ISIP was to provide infrastructure support to the IMPs. At
present, under EUROfusion, this expertise and tasks are ensured by the
Core Programming Team
under the
Infrastructure and Support Activities Work Package (WP-ISA CPT)
. Two further projects ensured the link with the experimentalists and
the provision of the experimental databases:

-  AMNS
   the "Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear Surface" Data
-  EDRG
   "Experimentalists and Diagnosticians Resource Group"

The "ITER Scenario Modelling Working Group" (ISM) was established in
2007 as part of EU-IM-TF with the aim to assist in systematic predictive
modelling of all ITER reference scenarios by using the major existing
integrated modelling tools, whilst the EU-IM code platform was in
development. ISM also supported the verification and validation of the
ETS, which aims to become the main tool for EU modelling activity.
