Code Development for integrated modelling Project
=================================================

The EUROfusion Project on Code Development for Integrated Modelling
(WP-CD) supports the achievement of the European Fusion Roadmap at
Horizon 2020 goals, via the development of existing modelling codes with
a particular focus on integrated modelling. The primary objectives of
WPCD are: 1. Provide a suite of codes that can be validated on existing
machines and used for JT-60SA, ITER and DEMO predictions:

-  build on the existing modelling codes developed by the EUROfusion
   Consortium members including the Integrated Modelling (EU-IM)
   infrastructure, toolset and codes developed under the former EFDA EU-IM
   Task Force,
-  add new physics to the existing models
-  couple codes into integrated workflows
-  optimize codes.

2. Specific ITER simulation work in support of ITER IO and F4E with
specified deliverables. WPCD operates under a work plan aiming to
provide in the long term a full suite of integrated simulation
workflows, incorporating core-edge-SOL/PFC coupling, first-principles
models and control elements. A central task is the development of the
new modular European Transport Simulator, ETS, which is being deployed
to JET modelling infrastructure for validation and application to
experimental analysis. In addition to code and workflow development,
rigorous code verification is also performed under WPCD, within the
EU-IM framework; whereas validation of the released integrated modelling
workflows against the experiments is performed under the rerelated Task
Forces.
